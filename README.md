# PaR's Seablock Speedrun
This is the repository of all blueprint books I've created in my attempts at speedrunning
[Seablock](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlockMetaPack) modpack.

## Brave New Speedblock (0.5.13)

My first attempt at speedrunning Seablock. Full video footage is available on YouTube:
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDrB_g0ay4stcIxjDnMsa5WdVqN7aqKVW).

The most notable thing about this run is that it's designed with
[Brave New World](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/brave-new-world)
mod in mind. This mod gives 50 logistic and 100 construction bots at the start at the cost of not having the character
and with that the ability to handcraft anything.

Self-imposed rules:
  * Imported blueprints respect current technology level for inserter pickup / dropoff / offset locations.
  * Imported blueprints respect *Circuit network* technology for circuit wires.
  * Usage of *prod beacons* feature / bug is allowed ([bug report](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=385839)).
  * Random map seed.

Real time is measured using an Auto-Splitter for [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/).

Full list of mods:
  * [Seablock Official Pack (0.5.13)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SeaBlockMetaPack)
