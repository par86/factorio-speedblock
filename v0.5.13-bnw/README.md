# Brave New Speedblock (0.5.13)

Here's the general plan of what I've been up to in each segment.

## Red science era (S01 - S05)

1. Rush mineral sludge
2. Stay on algae-1 for as long as possible, not even researching algae-2
3. Get 2 washing lines for landfill
4. Build as little power as possible while still staying fully in the green without any dips into yellow
5. Use robots only when charcoal buffer is not running out
6. Beeline to green science for Fast Electrolysis (slag-2)

### Segment 01 (Mineral Sludge)
Rush mineral sludge while cutting as many corners as possible.

Result:
* Researched Water treatment and Fluid control
* 6 algae-1 farms
* 4 electrolyzers
* 1 filtration unit and 2 crystallyzers
* 2 washing lines for landfill
* wooden boards / brown circuits production

### Segment 02 (Power Struggles)
Idea: Stabilize after rushing mineral sludge.

Result:
* Researched Long inserters 1 and Mechanical refining
* 16 algae-1 farms
* 10 electrolyzers
* 2 filtration units and 2 crystallyzers (need one more)

### Segment 03 (Iron & Copper Smelting)
Idea: Research metallurgy.

Result:
* Researched Iron smelting and Copper smelting
* 24 algae-1 farms
* 13 electrolyzers
* 2 filtration units and 4 crystallyzers

### Segment 04 (Green Algae Processing)
Idea: Pivoting from algae-1 to algae-2.

Result:
* Researched Green algae processing and Steel processing
* 4 algae-2 farms
* 20 electrolyzers
* 3 filtration units
* 3rd washing line almost built

### Segment 05 (First Green Science)
Idea: Produce 145 green science.

Result:
* Researched Green science
* Produced steel plates, green circuits, green science
* 6 algae-2 farms
* 20-26 electrolyzers
* 4 filtration units

## Green science era (S06 onward)

1. Rush first 145 green science for Fast Electrolysis (slag-2) and More Inserters 1 (45 degree inserters)
2. Upgrade from slag-1 to slag-2
3. Get Advanced iron smelting 1 (processed iron) and Advanced copper smelting 1 (processed copper) for 50% bonuses
4. Research Flammables for solid fuel
5. TBD

### Segment 06 (Fast Electrolysis)
Idea: Upgrade electrolyzers from slag-1 to slag-2.

Result:
* 16 slag-2 electrolyzers
* 10-16 slag-1 electrolyzers
* 45 degree inserters

### Segment 07 (Advanced Smelting)
Idea: Set up Advanced smelting for either iron or copper.
* processed iron is to be used with one saphirite and one stiratite sorters
* processed copper is to be used with two saphirite sorters, suitable only if pipes are full of molten iron

Result:
* TBD
